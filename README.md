# cisco-vlan-trunking

This lab demonstrates how to configure VLANs and trunking on Cisco switches using Packet Tracer.

## Objectives
1.  Understand the purpose of VLANs in a switched network.
2.  Create and configure VLANs on Cisco switches.
3.  Assign switch ports to specific VLANs.
4.  Configure trunk links to allow multiple VLANs across switches.
5.  Verify VLAN communication and isolation.

## Tasks Performed
1. Created VLAN 10 (Sales) and VLAN 20 (HR).
2. Assigned switch ports to VLANs.
3. Configured trunk ports between switches using IEEE 802.1Q.
4. Verified that:
   - PCs in the same VLAN can communicate (even across switches).
   - PCs in different VLANs are isolated unless Inter-VLAN Routing is configured.

## Key Learnings
1.  VLANs improve security and reduce broadcast traffic.
2.  Trunking enables VLAN information to travel across multiple switches.
